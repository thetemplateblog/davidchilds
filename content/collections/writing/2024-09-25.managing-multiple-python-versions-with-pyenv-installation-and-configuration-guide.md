title: 'Managing Multiple Python Versions with Pyenv: Installation and Configuration Guide'
intro: |-
  Python version management is critical in modern development environments. Pyenv, a popular tool for this purpose, allows developers to seamlessly switch between Python versions. However, discrepancies can arise between the configured pyenv version and the system's active Python installation.

  This technical guide addresses a specific issue: when pyenv global is set to version 3.10.10, but python3 --version reports an older version. The root cause often lies in shell configuration, PATH variable ordering, or shim directory precedence.

1. install pyenv : brew install pyenvofficial installation guide
2. install particular python: pyenv install 3.10.10
3. set python3.10.10 to gloabal python env: pyenv global 3.10.10

If you have already executed  `pyenv global 3.10.10`, but  `python3 --version`  still shows an older version (such as 3.9), it might be because  `pyenv`  is not correctly configured in your shell environment, or the system's  `PATH`  environment variable is not properly updated. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

### 1. Ensure  `pyenv`  is Properly Installed and Initialized

First, make sure you have correctly installed  `pyenv`, and that the initialization script for  `pyenv`  has been added to your shell configuration file.

#### For  `zsh`  Users:

Edit the  `~/.zshrc`  file:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc

```

Add the following lines (if not already added):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

```

#### For  `bash`  Users:

Edit the  `~/.bashrc`  or  `~/.bash_profile`  file:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc

```

Add the following lines (if not already added):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

```

### 2. Reload the Shell Configuration File

Save the file and exit the editor, then reload the configuration file:

#### For  `zsh`  Users:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc

```

#### For  `bash`  Users:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc

```

### 3. Confirm  `pyenv`  Configuration

Run the following command to ensure  `pyenv`  is correctly configured:

```bash
pyenv versions

```

You should see output similar to the following, where  `3.10.10`  has an asterisk indicating it is the global version:

```bash
* 3.10.10 (set by /Users/hu/.pyenv/version)
  system

```

### 4. Check the  `PATH`  Environment Variable

Ensure that the  `pyenv`  `shims`  directory is at the front of the  `PATH`  environment variable. Run the following command to check the  `PATH`:

```bash
echo $PATH

```

Ensure the output includes a path like  `~/.pyenv/shims`, and that it appears before other Python paths.

### 5. Verify the  `python3`  Version

Finally, verify the  `python3`  version:

```bash
python3 --version

```

You should see the version  `Python 3.10.10`.

### 6. Additional Checks

If the above steps still do not resolve the issue, you can try the following command to ensure the  `pyenv`  shims are up to date:

```bash
pyenv rehash

```

Also, ensure there are no other Python installation paths interfering:

```bash
which python3

```

It should point to  `~/.pyenv/shims/python3`.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully set  `pyenv`  to use version  `3.10.10`  as the default  `python3`.
