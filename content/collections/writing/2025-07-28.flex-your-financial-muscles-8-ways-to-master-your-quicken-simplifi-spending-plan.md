1. Mastering the Art of Available Spending

It's the end of the month, and your Simplifi app shows an inviting $400 of available spending. How do you resist the temptation? The secret is simple: allocate it to a Savings Goal. By doing so, you trick yourself into spending less while simultaneously working towards a future financial goal.

2. Plan Around Fluctuating Bills

Seasonal bills can wreak havoc on your budget. But with Quicken Simplifi, you can adjust your expected bill amounts to ensure your budget absorbs these fluctuations. Remember to set the recurring bill to ‘Match any amount’ for automatic adjustment to the actual amount.

3. Future-Proofing Large Expenses

Planning for significant expenses can be stressful. Simplifi offers a simple solution: Ignore the spending from your Spending Plan. This allows you to spend on large items without disrupting your monthly budget, ensuring your financial data remains intact.

4. Keep Necessary Funds Safe

Have you earmarked funds for a future expense? Ensure these funds aren't spent prematurely by adding the amount to your planned spending. Simplifi sets these funds aside, ensuring they're available when needed.

5. Managing Non-Bill Expenses

Expenses like groceries aren't technically bills but are regular nonetheless. By creating a Planned Spending expense, Simplifi will set aside funds for these predictable non-bill expenses, helping you manage your monthly outgoings better.

6. Preparing for Unexpected Expenses

Life is full of surprises, and so is your spending. Simplifi is designed to handle unpredictability. It's flexible enough to allow you to manage unexpected expenses without having to plan for every possibility.

7. Smoothing Out Annual Bills

Annual bills can be a significant blow to your budget. Simplifi allows you to turn these large yearly expenses into manageable monthly contributions, ensuring these bills are no longer a source of financial stress.

8. Aligning Income with Expenses

With Simplifi's Projected Cash Flow view, you can ensure your income aligns with your bills. It displays your upcoming income and expenses on a timeline, enabling you to plan your spending week by week.

Conclusion

A budget isn’t just a tracker of your past spending, it’s a tool to shape your financial future. Quicken Simplifi's Spending Plan offers the flexibility to adapt to your real-life spending habits and needs. With these eight hacks, you can effectively customize your budget, ensuring it works for you, not against you. Remember, your budget should be as dynamic, adaptable, and unique as your lifestyle. Keep tweaking, keep adjusting, and let your budget flex with your future.
