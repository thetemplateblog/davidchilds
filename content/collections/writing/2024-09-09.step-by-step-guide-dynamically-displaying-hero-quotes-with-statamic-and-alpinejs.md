**Prerequisites:**  
Before we get started, make sure you have basic knowledge of:
- Using **Statamic** CMS
- HTML and basic templating with **Antlers**
- **Tailwind CSS** for layout and styling (optional but very helpful)
- **Alpine.js** for lightweight JavaScript-driven interactivity

---

### Step 1: Setting Up Statamic and the `heros` Collection

To begin, we need a **collection** in Statamic named `heros` to store the hero quotes we want to display. In this case, each entry in the `heros` collection should have the following fields:
- **`quote`**: A rich text field for the quote itself
- **`quote_attribution`**: A text field to attribute the quote source
- **`content`**: Optional additional content, such as a longer explanation or background for the quote

#### Example `heros` Collection Entry

Hereâ€™s what one entry in the `heros` collection might look like:

```yaml
title: "Simplicity is the key to sophistication"
quote: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
quote_attribution: "Leonardo da Vinci"
content: "<p>Simplicity is the key to effective writing. By using clear and concise language, your message becomes more impactful. Complex ideas don't need complicated words to resonate.</p>"
```

In practice, weâ€™re going to **randomly display one hero quote** out of this collection using **Alpine.js** on the front end.

---

### Step 2: Setting Up the Blade/Antlers Template with Tailwind CSS

Now letâ€™s move to create the layout where these hero quotes will be displayed. The following template ensures we can pull in random items from the `heros` collection and display them in a visually appealing manner using Tailwind CSS.

Hereâ€™s what the context will look like in the **Antlers** template:

#### Template Structure with Collections and Tailwind

```antlers
{{ collection:heros id:not:id as="heros" }}
    <div class="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto" x-data="{ heros: {{ heros | to_json | sanitize:true }} }">
      <template x-for="hero in heros.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random()).slice(0, 1)" :key="hero.id">
        <div>
          <!-- Display the hero's quote -->
          <h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-light text-center mb-6" x-html="hero.quote"></h1>
          
          <!-- Display the quote attribution, right-aligned -->
          <div class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-gray-500 mt-6 block text-right">
            <span x-text="hero.quote_attribution"></span>
          </div>
          
          <!-- Display additional content -->
          <p class="text-xl text-left text-gray-600 mx-auto mt-6" x-html="hero.content"></p>  
        </div>
      </template>
    </div>
{{ /collection:heros }}
```

#### Key Explanation
- `{{ collection:heros as="heros" }}`: This fetches the collection of hero entries from Statamic.
- **Alpine.jsâ€™s `x-data`**: We use Alpine.js to dynamically fetch and manipulate the collection data inline, converting it into JSON via `{{ heros | to_json | sanitize:true }}`.
- **Randomization with `x-for`**: The `x-for` directive works like a loop in Alpine.js. By combining `.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random())` with `.slice(0, 1)`, we randomly shuffle the collection data and display only one item.
- **Tailwind CSS styling**: We use Tailwind classes for layout, typography, and spacing that make the quotes visually appealing.
  - `.text-right` aligns the attribution to the right.
  - `.mt-6` provides top margin to space elements effectively.

### Step 3: Enabling Alpine.js in the Project

At this stage, we need to ensure that **Alpine.js** is loaded correctly on the page. Without this, the interactive features (like random selection) wonâ€™t work. Hereâ€™s how you load Alpine.js in your project.

#### Loading Alpine.js

Add the following **script tag** in the `<head>` section (or just before the closing `</body>` tag) of your template to ensure Alpine.js is included:

```html
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
```

This will load **Alpine.js version 3.x** on the page, making it possible to use `x-data`, `x-for`, and other Alpine directives to dynamically manipulate content.

#### Verifying Alpine.js is Loaded

You can check if Alpine.js is loaded properly by typing `Alpine.version` into the Developer Console in your browser:
- If you see a version number (like `3.12.0`), **Alpine.js is loaded** correctly, and you can move on.
- If you get an error (like `Alpine is not defined`), it means Alpine is not loaded properly.

---

### Step 4: Adding More Dynamic Hero Entries

Beyond random selection, you can add as many **hero entries** as you like to the `heros` collection. Below is an example we'll add to the template:

#### Example Hero Entry in YAML:

```yaml
title: "Make It Simple"
quote: "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."
quote_attribution: "Albert Einstein"
content: "<p>Simplicity is powerful when it cuts to the essence while maintaining integrity. Stray too far into simplicity, and value can be lost. The true challenge is balancing clarity and complexity.</p>"
```

This will automatically pull in and be displayed under the random selection logic!

---

### Step 5: Customizing the Layout Further â€” Adding Margins

If youâ€™d like to style or add space between elementsâ€”or perhaps even add interactivityâ€”you can easily do so with Tailwind and Alpine.js.

For example, to add some spacing above the quote **content**, we added this code:

```html
<p class="text-xl text-left text-gray-600 mx-auto mt-6" x-html="hero.content"></p>
```

Here, the class `mt-6` adds a **1.5rem top margin**, but you can adjust it to `mt-4`, `mt-8`, etc., depending on how much spacing you need.

---

### Step 6: Debugging and Logging the Data

To make sure the data is loading correctly in Alpine.js, you can use the `x-init` directive to log your heroes collection to the console:

```html
<div class="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto" x-data="{ heros: {{ heros | to_json | sanitize:true }} }" x-init="console.log(heros)">
```

This helps you verify whether the `heros` collection is being passed correctly from Statamic to Alpine.js and how the data is structured.

---

### Final Thoughts

With **Statamic + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS**, you can easily create dynamic and interactive portions of your website, like random quotes from a collection. This approach allows for flexibility, fast performance without heavy JavaScript frameworks, and dynamic manipulation right on the DOM without the need for complex backend code.

By simply using **x-data** and **x-for**, Alpine.js turns a collection fetched in Statamic into a live, interactive experience. Combined with Tailwind CSS, the quotes are styled responsively with a minimal amount of custom CSS required.

### Full Code Example:

Hereâ€™s the **full working code** after putting everything together:

```antlers
{{ collection:heros id:not:id as="heros" }}
    <div class="max-w-screen-xl mx-auto" x-data="{ heros: {{ heros | to_json | sanitize:true }} }">
      <template x-for="hero in heros.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random()).slice(0, 1)" :key="hero.id">
        <div>
          <!-- Display the hero's quote -->
          <h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-light text-center mb-6" x-html="hero.quote"></h1>
          
          <!-- Display the quote attribution, right-aligned -->
          <div class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl text-gray-500 mt-6 block text-right">
            <span x-text="hero.quote_attribution"></span>
          </div>
          
          <!-- Display additional content -->
          <p class="text-xl text-left text-gray-600 mx-auto mt-6" x-html="hero.content"></p>
        </div>
      </template>
    </div>
{{ /collection:heros }}
```

Use this approach and feel free to extend it by adding more functionality, modifying styles, or adding more interaction! ðŸ˜Š
