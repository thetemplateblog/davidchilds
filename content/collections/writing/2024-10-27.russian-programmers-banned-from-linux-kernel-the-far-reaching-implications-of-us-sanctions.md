## Introduction

In a recent development that has sent shockwaves through the open-source community, longtime Russian contributors to the Linux kernel have been banned from participation. This move, stemming from U.S. sanctions against Russia, has potential ramifications far beyond just the Linux project. Let's delve into the details of this situation and its broader implications for GPL software.

## The Linux Kernel Maintainer File Change

On October 18, 2024, Greg Kroah-Hartman, the maintainer of the stable branch of the Linux kernel and a top figure in the Linux community, made a significant change to the kernel's maintainers file. This file, which lists trusted contributors responsible for specific areas of the kernel, saw the removal of several Russian programmers. These weren't just casual contributors but long-term, well-established maintainers of crucial components including:

- Networking drivers
- Drive controllers
- Display drivers
- ARM architecture support
- UFS file system

The only explanation provided for this change was a vague comment citing "various compliance requirements" and suggesting that removed individuals could potentially return if "sufficient documentation" was provided.

## The Root Cause: Executive Order 14071

The driving force behind this action appears to be President Biden's Executive Order 14071, which prohibits working with Russian individuals, companies, or organizations on information technology and services. This order, signed on April 6, 2022, took full effect on September 12, 2024, with a 90-day grace period for organizations to comply.

## GPL Software and Legal Precedent

A 2017 court case (Artifex Software v. Hancom Inc.) established that accepting the GPL license constitutes entering into a legally enforceable contract with the copyright holder of the GPL software. This precedent, combined with EO 14071, means that Russian programmers contributing to GPL software owned by U.S. entities could be seen as entering into contracts prohibited by the sanctions.

## Broader Implications for Open Source

This situation isn't limited to the Linux kernel. It potentially affects all GPL software with copyright held by U.S. entities, including projects under organizations like the Software Freedom Conservancy and the Free Software Foundation. Popular software like Inkscape could be impacted, leading to bans on Russian contributors across numerous open-source projects.

## Uncertainties and Potential Consequences

1. **Quality of Software**: With experienced maintainers suddenly removed, there are concerns about the ongoing quality and maintenance of affected software components.
2. **New Projects**: Banned programmers may start their own software projects in Russia, potentially fragmenting the open-source landscape.
3. **Compliance Challenges**: Projects that don't comply with these sanctions may face legal consequences, though the exact nature of enforcement remains unclear.
4. **Global Impact**: Even non-U.S. projects with American contributors may need to reconsider their relationship with Russian developers.

## Conclusion

As we approach the December 11, 2024 deadline for full compliance, the open-source community faces a period of uncertainty. The long-term effects on software quality, project maintenance, and international collaboration in open-source development remain to be seen. This situation highlights the complex interplay between geopolitics, law, and the global nature of software development.

We'll continue to monitor this situation as it unfolds, particularly watching for similar actions in other major open-source projects and any potential shifts in policy or enforcement approaches.
