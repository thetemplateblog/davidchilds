**Dave Ramsey**
Dave Ramsey's advice on money has led to less spending and paid-off debts. Man vs Debt has shown me the way, with a series of simple money management steps to follow. His radio show keeps me inspired to continue saving money and educate others on how they could do the same.

**Sal Di Stefano**
Sal's fitness advice molded me into a stronger, healthier person. It was his podcast that first made it clear to me: you have got to eat just as well as you work out. Thanks to Sal's wise words, I now have a handle on working out safe and sound while making progressâ€”albeit slower than my ambitious self would like!

**Dickie Bush and Nicolas Cole**
When it comes to the world of online writing, I try to follow some great advice provided by Dickie Bush and Nicolas Cole. Their "Ship 30 for 30" challenge made me put out something every day, which has helped me quickly come up with ideas and develop a following on social media.

I have learned a great deal from these individuals, and as they did for me, I hope to pass on all the learning further down.
