## What You’ll Need

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** - The base editor.
- **Continue Dev** - Extension for code auto-completion and chat-based code assistance.
- **Claud Dev** - Extension for multi-file editing and project automation.
- **A Local Model via AMA (Optional)** - For offline autocomplete functionalities.

## Setting Up Your Cursor-like Environment

### Step 1: Install VS Code

If you haven't already, download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Step 2: Install Continue Dev

1. Open VS Code.
2. Navigate to the Extensions tab (usually on the sidebar).
3. Search for "Continue Dev".
4. Click "Install" to add the extension to your VS Code setup.

After successful installation, Continue Dev will appear in your sidebar. You can use it for AI-driven code generation and chat about code directly in your workspace.

### Step 3: Set Up Code Autocomplete with Continue Dev

1. Click the "Continue Dev" icon in the sidebar.
2. In the interface, select "Model" and then "Add".
3. Choose a provider (e.g., Anthropic) and input your API key.
4. Return to the chat screen, where you can now interact with code files and generate code snippets using the chat feature.

You can insert generated code into files using the "Insert At Cursor" option or utilize the shortcut Command + I.

### Step 4: Enhancing Autocomplete with a Local Model

For superior autocomplete, consider using a local model:
1. Visit the [AMA website](https://ama.example.com/) to download your preferred model.
2. Choose your OS and follow installation instructions.
3. Install your preferred model, such as the "quen 2 1.5b".
4. In VS Code, go to Continue Dev settings, find "Autocomplete", and change the model name to your installed model.

### Step 5: Install Claud Dev for Multi-file Editing

To set up Claud Dev:
1. Go to the Extensions tab in VS Code.
2. Search for "Claud Dev" and install it.
3. Once installed, Claud Dev will appear in your sidebar.

To configure Claud Dev:
1. Click the Claud Dev icon.
2. Access settings and input your API key.
3. Optionally, use Open Router for different model connections.

With Claud Dev ready, you can automate tasks across multiple files, like configuring a simple Minesweeper game using just prompts.

### Step 6: Using Claud Dev

Use the interface to enter prompts for code tasks:
- The extension will automatically generate and modify code across your working files.
- It prompts you to approve changes, and runs commands to execute applications directly from VS Code.

## Cost Efficiency and Customization

Claud Dev's prompt caching reduces API call costs significantly, making it cheaper to generate complex codes than using a paid service like Cursor. By using alternative models like Gemini Flash, you can further reduce costs and even achieve free usage under certain conditions.

## Conclusion and Wrap-Up

By following this tutorial, you've set up a powerful and privacy-conscious VS Code environment that not only mimics Cursor's capabilities but also offers extensive customizations. This approach is especially beneficial for those who prefer pay-as-you-go pricing models over fixed monthly fees.
