## Never Get Surprised by an Overdraft Again

The average overdraft fee is $35, and Americans pay billions in these fees annually. Projected Cash Flow shows you exactly when your accounts will run low—days, weeks, or even months in advance. 

Our intelligent forecasting analyzes your recurring transactions and upcoming expenses to paint a complete picture of your future balances. One avoided overdraft fee pays for 7 months of the service.

## Pay Off Debt Years Faster (and Save Thousands)

Our built-in Debt Snowball Calculator isn't just another debt tool—it's a game-changer. By showing you exactly how extra payments accelerate your payoff timeline, it motivates you to find that extra $50 or $100 each month.

The average user saves:
- **27 months** of payments
- **$1,200+** in interest charges
- Countless hours of stress

The calculator handles the complex math of daily credit card interest versus monthly loan interest, giving you accurate projections you can trust.

## Make Major Purchases with Confidence

Planning a vacation? Considering a new car? Our one-time transaction planning feature lets you add future expenses to see their exact impact on your cash flow. No more guessing if you can afford something—you'll know with certainty.
