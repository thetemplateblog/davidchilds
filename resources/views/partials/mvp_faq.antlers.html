    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">How is this different from no-code tools?</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-600">You get real code, real infrastructure, and can scale without platform limitations. Everything is built with production-grade tools and deployed to your own accounts.</p>
</div>

<div class="border-b border-neutral-200 pb-6">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">What if my idea needs custom functionality?</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-600">The validation sprint focuses on testing your core value proposition. Custom features come in the MVP development phase after validation proves there's demand.</p>
</div>

<div class="border-b border-neutral-200 pb-6">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Do I own the code?</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-600">Yes, 100%. Everything I build is yours, deployed to your accounts. You receive full source code and can continue development with any developer.</p>
</div>

<div class="border-b border-neutral-200 pb-6">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">What if validation fails?</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-600">That's a success! You saved $50K and months of your life. 20% of my clients pivot based on data, and many find even better opportunities through the validation process.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">How does the AI-powered idea canvas work?</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-600">Our AI assistant guides you through structured questions about your target market, problem, solution, and business model. It helps identify gaps in your thinking, suggests validation metrics, and even recommends competitor research. You can also just upload a doc if you prefer.</p>

<div class="border-b border-neutral-200 pb-6">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">What happens after validation?</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-600">If metrics are good, we can discuss MVP development with equity/revenue share options. Validated ideas get 50% off MVP development, and you'll have real data to attract investors or partners.</p>

<div class="border-b border-neutral-200 pb-6">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">How quickly can we start?</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-600">Usually within 48 hours of our initial call. I maintain limited availability to ensure quality, so current wait times are displayed at the bottom of the page.</p>

<div class="border-b border-neutral-200 pb-6">
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">Do you handle marketing and traffic generation?</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-600">No - you're responsible for driving traffic through your network, paid ads, content, or cold outreach. I provide the technical infrastructure: landing pages, analytics, A/B testing, and data dashboards. This keeps costs low and lets you control your marketing message and budget.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">What tech stack do you use?</h3>
    <p class="text-neutral-600">I use modern, scalable technologies tailored to each project. Typically Next.js/React for frontend, Node.js or Python for backend, PostgreSQL for database, and AWS/Vercel for hosting. Everything is chosen for rapid deployment and future scalability.</p>
